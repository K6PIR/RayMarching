# RayMarching


Based on differents youtube tutorials, I worked on metaballs implementation thanks a raymarching algorithm.
With this project I could learn how to use shaders on UNITY.

## Usage

Open the folder RayMarching inside the repository with UNITY to use it.
If you want to play, just build a version with UNITY.
